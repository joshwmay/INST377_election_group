# pgc_election_group
This repository is intended to be used in completing a group project in INST 377 DUE IN DECEMBER 2019

Our group decided to work with Prince George's County voting information and attempt to create an informative prototype
webpage allowing users to use an interactive ballot that also presents information about the contents of a ballot 
measure.

Users viewing the page will also be able to get a better understanding of how elections work based on at least one 
embedded feature made available from GitHub user Nicky Case (ncase) and https://ncase.me/ballot/

Additionally, users will be able to view polling places and can choose an interactive ballot based on polling place, 
as there are different things to be voted on depending on district/precinct.

Ideally a user would be able to use the webpage to understand what their voting options are, better understand how 
their vote counts, and be able to navigate to their polling place through links generated.

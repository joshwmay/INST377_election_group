- This repository is intended to be used in completing a group project in INST 377 DUE IN DECEMBER 2019

- Our group decided to work with Maryland's Prince George's County voting information and attempt to create an informative         prototype webpage allowing users to use an interactive ballot that also presents information about the contents of a ballot      measure.

- Users viewing the page will also be able to get a better understanding of how elections work based on at least one 
  embedded feature made available from GitHub user Nicky Case (ncase) and https://ncase.me/ballot/.

- Links were generated with multiple resources including Google maps and ballotpedia.org. 

- Users can view polling places and can choose an interactive ballot based on polling place, 
  as there are different things to be voted on depending on district/precinct.

- Ideally a user would be able to use the webpage to understand what their voting options are, better understand how 
  their vote counts, and be able to navigate to their polling place through links generated.


PGC_Election_Group

The topic of this project is voting in Prince Georgeâ€™s County (PGC) elections, but the purpose is to help prepare voters with general information and digital ballots that are more informative and helpful in assisting the preparation of users with limited accessibility intending to vote. Users could ideally give feedback related to ballot errors, confusing questions, or general comments. People concerned with these issues include citizens who are going to vote, new and inexperienced voters, and people with low political literacy. For purposes of narrowing our scope and making something that is actually used, our stakeholders can be more directly defined as PGC citizens that intend to vote, but are not sure what their options are.
